# 🚀 Deployment Guide for ShareMeOnline

Your WebRTC file sharing application has been deployed! However, there are some important considerations about deployment platforms.

## 📋 Current Deployment Status

✅ **Vercel Deployment**: https://sharemeeonline-f1lji7nh3-dineshs-projects-19d7e016.vercel.app
❌ **Socket.IO Limitation**: Vercel's serverless functions don't support persistent WebSocket connections

## 🔧 Recommended Deployment Platforms

Since this app uses Socket.IO for real-time communication, you'll need a platform that supports persistent connections:

### 1. 🟢 **Railway** (Recommended)
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

### 2. 🟢 **Render**
1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Create a new Web Service
3. Set build command: `npm install`
4. Set start command: `npm start`

### 3. 🟢 **Heroku**
```bash
npm install -g heroku
heroku login
heroku create your-app-name
git push heroku main
```

### 4. 🟢 **DigitalOcean App Platform**
1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Choose Node.js runtime
3. Auto-deploy on commits

## 🛠 Alternative: Client-Only Version for Vercel

For Vercel deployment, you can use a client-only version that works on local networks:

### Features:
- ✅ Works on Vercel/Netlify/GitHub Pages
- ✅ No server required
- ❌ Limited to local network connections
- ❌ No room management

## 📱 Current Live App

🔗 **Live URL**: https://sharemeeonline-f1lji7nh3-dineshs-projects-19d7e016.vercel.app

⚠️ **Note**: The live Vercel version will have limited functionality due to WebSocket restrictions. For full functionality, deploy to Railway, Render, or Heroku.

## 🏠 Local Development

To run locally with full functionality:
```bash
npm install
npm start
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

## 🔑 Environment Variables (if needed)

For production deployments, you might want to set:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT=3000` (or let the platform set it)
