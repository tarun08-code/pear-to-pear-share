## Network Configuration

### For Local Network Use

### For Internet Use
For transfers across the internet, you may need to configure STUN/TURN servers:

1. Edit the `rtcConfig` in `index.html`
2. Add your TURN server credentials:
```javascript
const rtcConfig = {
  iceServers: [
    { urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' },
    { 
      urls: 'turn:your-turn-server.com:3478',
      username: 'your-username',
      credential: 'your-password'
    }
  ]
};
```

## Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
npm start
```

### Production Deployment
1. Set environment variable: `PORT=your-port`
2. Use a process manager like PM2:
```bash
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start server.js --name sharemeeonline
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Ensure both devices are on the same network (for local use)
- Check firewall settings
- Try refreshing both browsers
- Verify the 6-digit code is correct

### File Transfer Problems
- Large files may take time to establish connection
